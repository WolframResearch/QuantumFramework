# QuantumFramework – Ongoing Projects: Courses

> **Note:** This section is part of an ongoing effort to develop educational materials in the form of three books.

---

## Overview
The **OngoingProjects/Courses** directory is a living project focused on authoring and curating three textbooks (or comprehensive digital books) designed to teach and explore quantum computation through the Wolfram Quantum Framework.

## Goals
- **Write three complete books** that serve as in-depth educational resources for quantum computing using the Wolfram Language and the QuantumFramework.
- Cover theoretical foundations, practical examples, and advanced topics within each volume.
- Leverage the expressive symbolic and numeric capabilities of the Wolfram Quantum Framework throughout the texts.


### Suggested Content Breakdown
- **[Book 1: Introduction to quantum computing](https://github.com/WolframResearch/QuantumFramework/tree/main/OngoingProjects/Courses/IntroToQuantumComputing)** Concepts of quantum mechanics, quantum states, operators, measurement, entanglement, and quantum algorithms .
- **[Book 2: Quantum optics](https://github.com/WolframResearch/QuantumFramework/tree/main/OngoingProjects/Courses/QuantumOptics)** Construction and simulation of 2nd quantization cases with special attention to quantum topics.
- **[Book 3: Quantum optimization](https://github.com/WolframResearch/QuantumFramework/tree/main/OngoingProjects/Courses/QuantumOptimization)** application of quantum computing for quantum optimization.

## How to Contribute
- Contributions are welcomed! Please fork the repository, create a branch for the book you’d like to work on (e.g., `book1-writing`), and open a pull request for proposed sections, examples, or diagrams.
- We are especially looking for:
  - Illustrative notebooks showcasing code examples.
  - Clear, pedagogical explanations suitable for students and researchers.
  - Visual content such as circuit diagrams, Bloch sphere illustrations, and state visualizations.
